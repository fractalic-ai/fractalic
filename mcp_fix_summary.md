## MCP Tool Integration Summary

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Corrected command line argument order** in fractalic_mcp_manager_v2.py - Now using:
   `python3 fractalic_mcp_manager_v2.py --port 5859 serve` instead of `python3 fractalic_mcp_manager_v2.py serve --port 5859`

2. **Added JSON serialization support** to the MCP server:
   - Created MCPEncoder class to properly serialize dataclasses, pydantic models, and CallToolResult objects
   - Updated all web.json_response calls to use the custom encoder

3. **Fixed ToolRegistry._load_mcp** to:
   - Properly iterate through all service types from each MCP server response
   - Add robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Include service name in tool registration for better traceability

4. **Fixed ToolRegistry._register** to handle MCP tools without 'entry' field:
   - Added special handling for from_mcp=True case
   - Ensure parameters exist and have proper structure
   - Create a runner function that properly calls mcp_call with server and tool name

### Results:

- Successfully registered 53 MCP tools from 4 different services:
  - mcp-installer (2 tools)
  - mcp-server-fetch (4 tools)
  - playwright-mcp-server (29 tools)
  - mcp-notion-server (18 tools)

- All tools are properly included in the schema sent to the LLM
