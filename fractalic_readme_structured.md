## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Method 1: Pre-Built Docker Image (Recommended)
Run the published container directly with all services (UI + API + AI server):
```bash
docker run -d --name fractalic --network bridge -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 -p 5859:5859 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --env HOST=0.0.0.0 ghcr.io/fractalic-ai/fractalic:main
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000

#### Method 2: Build from Source (Full Stack)
Builds latest version from GitHub repositories and runs in Docker:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fractalic-ai/fractalic/main/deploy/docker-deploy.sh | bash
```
This clones both fractalic + fractalic-ui, builds Docker image locally, and starts all services:
- UI: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8000
- AI Server: http://localhost:8001
- MCP Manager: http://localhost:5859

#### Method 3: Local Development Setup
Full source installation with both backend and frontend for development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fractalic-ai/fractalic.git
cd fractalic
./local-dev-setup.sh
```
This script will:
- Clone fractalic-ui repository
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Start both backend and frontend servers
- Open http://localhost:3000 automatically

#### Method 4: Python Package (CLI Only)
Install when you only need the command-line runner (no UI):
```bash
pip install fractalic
```

##### Basic CLI Usage
Check install:
```bash
fractalic --help
```
[DIMA>] Здесь нужно без примера просто как запустить с файлом

Create and run a minimal workflow:
```bash
cat > hello.md <<'EOF'
# Goal {id=goal}
Generate a short greeting.

@llm
prompt: Greeting
blocks: goal
use-header: "# Result {id=result}"
EOF

fractalic hello.md
```

##### Usage as Python Module
```python
import fractalic

# Run a workflow file
result = fractalic.run('workflow.md')

# Run with parameters
result = fractalic.run('workflow.md', parameters={'company': 'Tesla'})

# Run workflow content directly
workflow_content = """
# Analysis {id=task}
Research the company mentioned in parameters.

@llm
prompt: Analyze
blocks: task
"""
result = fractalic.run_content(workflow_content, parameters={'company': 'Apple'})
print(result)
```

## Basic Principles
- **One executable Markdown file**: Your workflow specification *is* your runtime. Write what you want in plain Markdown, run it directly. No translation between documentation and code.

- **No glue code**: Replace Python/JS/(any program language) orchestration scripts with 3-6 line YAML plain-text operations. 

- **Multi-model workflows**: Switch between LLM models and providers in the same document. 

- **Precise context control**: Your Markdown becomes a manageable LLM context as an addressable tree. Reference exact sections, branches, or lists. LLMs see only what you specify—no hidden prompt stuffing.

- **Tool integration**: Connect MCP servers, Python functions, and shell commands. All outputs flow back into your document structure for the next operation.

- **Human‑readable audit trail**: Each run outputs a stepwise execution tree plus a complete change log (new blocks, edits, tool calls). Skim it like a focused diff—only actions and their effects, no noise.



# Fractalic Operations
[DIMA>] здесь]нужно короткое интро какое-то что во фракталике есть ключевые операции которые детерменировано исполняются интерпретатором:

- `@llm` – Send specific blocks to any model and provider, including local models.
[DIMA>] проверить с точки зрения ангилйского языка предложение про @llm выше

- `@shell` – Run terminal commands. Output becomes a new block.
- `@run` – Execute another Markdown file. Pass parameters, get results back.
- `@import` – Include content from other files.
- `@return` – Send blocks back to parent workflow.

[DIMA>] здесь нужно добавить короткое предложение что каждая из операций имеет большое количество настраиваемых параметров (и поставить ссылку на соотвествущий раздел в документации)


# Basic Examples

[DIMA>] Короткая вводная коротко суммаризующая что на базе этих операций (YAML синтаксис) + знаний (Маркдаун блокм) какие примеры будут показаны дальше

[DIMA>] нужно изменить заголовк каждого примера (с ### на ##) и добавить перед примером два три предложения что делает пример с точки зрения результата и обратить внимание что зеленым показан результирующий контекст после сохранения в файл ("+" показывается из-за специфики gihub маркдауна - а реальности его не будет в выводе)И упомянуть что часть вывода инструментов обрезана чтобы сократить размер примеров

### Web Search → Notion Page (MCP Integration)
```markdown

```

**How this works:**
Think of this workflow as a two-step process. First, we tell an AI model to search the web for news. Then, we tell it to take those search results and save them to a Notion page.

In the first `@llm` step, Fractalic combines the instructions from the `# Web search task` with the `tavily_search` tool. By telling the model exactly which tool to use, we make its job simpler and avoid unnecessary processing costs (tokens). The results, including the raw data from the tool, are neatly stored back into our document under new headings.

For the second `@llm` step, we give the model the instructions from `# Notion task` and the clean `# AI news` results from the previous step. Notice that we don't show it the messy, raw JSON data from the search tool. This is Fractalic's "context isolation" in action: each step gets only the information it needs. This keeps the process efficient and the document clean.

**What happened here:**
[DIMA>] ниже неправильно - tavily_search это тул фракталика - поэтому нужно правильно написать что это пример когда MCP работает в связке с тулами
- **MCP Integration**: Two different MCP servers (`tavily_search` and `mcp/notion`) work seamlessly together in sequence
- **Tool Output → Document Flow**: Web search results automatically become structured content in the document tree, which the next operation can reference
- **Context Control**: Each `@llm` operation sees only the specific blocks it needs—no hidden prompt stuffing or context pollution
- **Multi-step Automation**: Complex workflow (search → format → save to external service) runs with just two simple operations
- **Real API Integration**: Shows actual OAuth-authenticated API calls to external services, with real URLs and IDs returned

```

**How this works:**
This example shows how Fractalic can connect to an online service (Replicate) to create an image, then use your computer's own tools to download and open it.

The first `@llm` step is a two-part conversation with the Replicate service. First, it asks for the "schema" of the image model. Think of this as asking for the instruction manual. With that information, it then makes a second call to actually generate the bunny image.

The second `@llm` step switches gears completely. It uses the `shell_tool` to run commands directly on your computer. It takes the image URL from the first step and uses standard command-line tools like `curl` to download the image and `open` to view it. This demonstrates how easily Fractalic can bridge the gap between cloud services and your local machine.

**What happened here:**
- **Tool Chaining**: MCP Replicate integration followed by shell commands, demonstrating how different tool types work together
- **Cross-Platform Commands**: Shell tools automatically adapt to the OS (macOS `open` command used here)
- **Structured Output Parsing**: Model schemas are retrieved and used programmatically, showing API-first tool integration
- **File System Integration**: Generated content flows from cloud APIs to local files seamlessly

### Context Compression Pattern

+ # LLM response block
+ - Architecture: decoder-only transformer (GPT family).
+ - Input processing: tokenization → token embeddings; positional information added.
+ - Core stack: repeated transformer blocks with multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks; residual connections and layer normalization around sublayers.
+ - Attention: causal (masked) self-attention so each token can attend only to previous tokens.
+ - Multi-head attention: splits representations into multiple heads to capture diverse relationships in parallel.
+ - Feed-forward sublayer: two linear transformations with a nonlinearity applied independently at each position.
+ - Output: final layer projects to token logits → probabilities for next-token prediction.
+ - Training objective: next-token prediction on very large text corpora.
+ - Scaling: capabilities improve with more data, larger model size, and longer training (scaling laws).
+ - Alignment/finetuning: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) used to improve usefulness and safety.
+ - Inference: autoregressive token-by-token generation.
+ - Decoding methods: greedy, beam search, top-k/top-p sampling, and temperature control — trade off determinism, diversity, and quality.
+ - Practical concerns: latency and memory footprint scale with model size and context length.
+ - Safety/mitigation: filtering and guardrails to reduce harmful outputs.
+ - Limitations: propensity to hallucinate facts, reflect training-data biases, and require large compute/resources.
+ - Common applications: summarization, code generation, question answering, and dialog.

@llm
prompt: extract consice detailed info from data above - keep only knowledge, remove noise

```

**How this works:**
[DIMA>] здесь буллшит про чатти написано - надо прямо написать что ЛЛМ. процессе работы особенно использования тулов генерирует много токенов и проблема в архитектура ЛЛМ такая что кждый вызов ЛЛМ (например передача результатов работы тула) при каждом вызове передает полностью накопленный контекст

AI models can sometimes be a bit too chatty. This example shows how you can use Fractalic to keep your document tidy and efficient.

The first `@llm` step asks the model to generate a few paragraphs about GPT architecture. The model does its job and produces a detailed, but potentially verbose, block of text under the heading `# Some large output`.

[DIMA>] не используй маркетингоыв слва типа magic  в readme на github

The second `@llm` step is where the magic happens. It uses `mode: replace` to tell Fractalic: "take the content in the `# Some large output` block, summarize it, and then replace the original text with your summary." This is a powerful way to manage your document. You get the benefit of the detailed information, but you end up with a clean, concise version that's cheaper and faster to use in later steps. The block's address (`some-large-output`) stays the same, so other parts of your workflow won't break.

**What happened here:**
- **Replace Mode**: The `mode: replace` operation shows how content can be compressed in-place to save tokens
- **Block Targeting**: The `to: some-large-output` parameter precisely targets which block to replace
- **Token Cost Control**: Large generated content gets distilled into essential facts, reducing costs for subsequent operations
- **Content Evolution**: Document structure evolves from verbose to concise while preserving knowledge
- **Memory Management**: Demonstrates how to handle large outputs without context overflow

# Wiki

## USA
+ The United States of America is a large federal republic in North America made up of 50 states and the federal district of Washington, D.C.; it has a diverse landscape ranging from coasts and plains to mountains and deserts and a population of about 330 million people. As the world's largest economy by nominal GDP, the U.S. is a global leader in technology, finance, entertainment, and higher education, and it hosts a wide mix of cultures and ethnicities due to centuries of immigration. Governed by a constitutional system with separation of powers, the country plays a major role in international politics, trade, and culture.

## France
+ France is a country in Western Europe with a population of about 67 million and its capital in Paris; French is the official language and the government is a semi-presidential republic. A founding member of the European Union and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, France has a large, diversified economy driven by industries such as aerospace, luxury goods, agriculture and tourism, and it uses the euro as its currency. Renowned worldwide for its culture, cuisine and wine, art and fashion, France features iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, and diverse landscapes ranging from Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts to the Alps and Pyrenees.

## UK
+ The United Kingdom (officially the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) is a sovereign country in northwestern Europe made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a population of about 67 million and its capital in London. It is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system, and its economy is large and service-oriented—notably finance, education, research, creative industries and tourism—using the pound sterling as its currency. A permanent member of the UN Security Council and a G7 country, the UK played a central historical role through its former empire; it exited the European Union in 2020. The UK is renowned for its cultural institutions, universities, and landmarks such as Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament (Big Ben), and Stonehenge, and it features a variety of landscapes from lowland plains to upland highlands and rugged coastlines.

**How this works:**
[DIMA>] это не most advanced фича - это уникальная фича - полиморфизм и дианмический доступ для ИИ к управлению своим исполнением - добавь почему это важно и как можно использовать
This example showcases one of Fractalic's most advanced features: 
letting the AI build its own workflow.

We start with a simple `# Wiki` block that has a few subheadings for different countries. We then give the model the `fractalic_opgen` tool and a simple instruction: for each country, create a new operation to write a paragraph about it.

The model examines the structure of the document, sees the three country subheadings, and uses the `fractalic_opgen` tool to generate three new `@llm` operations. Each new operation is perfectly formatted to target one of the subheadings (`to: usa`, `to: france`, `to: uk`) and replace the placeholder text with a detailed paragraph.

This is a form of meta-programming: the AI is writing instructions for itself to execute. It allows you to create flexible and adaptive workflows that can change based on the content of your document, without you having to write every single step by hand.

**What happened here:**
- **Self-Extending Workflows**: The `fractalic_opgen` tool allows models to generate new operations dynamically
- **Block-Aware Generation**: The model analyzed the document structure (`# Wiki` with country subheadings) and created appropriate operations
- **Operation Templates**: Generated operations follow proper YAML structure with parameters like `mode: replace` and `to:` targeting
- **Content Replacement**: Original placeholder text ("something about USA") gets replaced with rich, factual content
- **Meta-Programming**: Shows how Fractalic can modify its own execution flow based on document content
